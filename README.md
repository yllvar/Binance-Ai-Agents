  D --> E[Tapas Model]
  D --> F[DistilBERT Model]
  D --> G[DeepSeek Model]
  D --> H[BART Model]
  D --> I[Fallback Mechanisms]
  C --> J[Trading Execution]
  J --> K[Binance API]
  C --> L[Market Data]

- **Model Performance Tracking**: Metrics collection for model evaluation  

### 1.3 Design Patterns

The codebase implements several notable design patterns:

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Used for interchangeable trading strategies and model selection  
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Provides unified interface to different AI models  
3. **Factory Pattern**: Creates appropriate model instances based on configuration  
4. **Observer Pattern**: Implemented for real-time updates via WebSockets  
5. **Singleton Pattern**: Used for the Trading Manager to ensure a single point of control  

### 1.4 Code Quality Assessment

| Aspect         | Rating      | Notes                                                      |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Modularity     | High        | Clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces |
| Error Handling | High        | Comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms     |
| Testability    | Medium      | Some components lack unit tests                           |
| Documentation  | Medium      | Good inline documentation but lacks comprehensive API docs|
| Performance    | Medium-High | Efficient implementations with some optimization opportunities |

### 1.5 Technical Debt

1. **Error Handling Consistency**: Some components have more robust error handling than others  
2. **Type Safety**: Some areas could benefit from stricter TypeScript typing  
3. **Test Coverage**: Limited automated testing increases risk of regressions  
4. **Configuration Management**: Hardcoded values in some components that should be configurable

### 2.2 Performance Metrics

| Capability          | Performance | Reliability | Notes                                                       |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Analysis  | High        | Medium      | Tapas model occasionally unavailable (503 errors)           |
| Sentiment Analysis  | Medium      | High        | DistilBERT is more reliable but less accurate               |
| Decision Making     | High        | Low         | DeepSeek provides good decisions but has reliability issues |
| Summarization       | Medium      | Medium      | BART provides adequate summaries with occasional failures   |
| Trade Execution     | High        | High        | Binance API integration is robust                           |

### 2.3 Resilience Features

1. **Multi-tier Fallback System**: Each model has multiple fallback options  
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning with reduced capabilities during failures  
3. **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff  
4. **Monitoring Alerts**: Visual indicators for model status in UI  

### 2.4 Limitations

1. **Model Availability**: Dependent on Hugging Face API availability  
2. **Latency Issues**: API calls introduce latency that may impact time-sensitive trades  
3. **Limited Context**: Models lack memory of previous market conditions  
4. **Fixed Strategies**: Trading strategies are relatively static without continuous learning

# Cost-clusion

Strategic optimization through model consolidation, batch processing, and selective use of dedicated endpoints, 
could reduce costs by 30-40% while maintaining acceptable performance. Long-term investment in model distillation, 
and custom development could further reduce operating costs while potentially improving performance.
